  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Pancakes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cinnamon Swirl Filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>5 ½ tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cream Cheese Icing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Stir milk and vinegar together in a bowl; set aside until milk "sours",
      about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a
      separate bowl. Whisk egg, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons
      vanilla extract into milk mixture. Slowly pour milk mixture into flour
      mixture while whisking constantly until batter is just moistened and
      evenly mixed. Lumps are fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
      Place a 1-quart resealable bag into a glass or cup. Pour cinnamon mixture
      into the bag; refrigerate until filling is as thick as toothpaste, about
      10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix 1/4 cup softened butter and cream cheese together in a microwave-safe
      bowl; heat in microwave for 40 seconds. Stir mixture with a whisk or fork
      until smooth. Continue heating in microwave and stirring until mixture is
      completely melted. Stir confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
      extract into cream cheese mixture until icing is smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.
      Pour about 2/3 cup batter into the center of griddle. Cook pancake until
      bubbles start to appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut 1 corner off the center of
      the bag with filling. Swirl filling over pancake, leaving enough space
      around edges that filling doesn't touch the griddle.
    </li>
    <li>
      Flip pancake and cook until other side is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
      Drizzle icing over pancake. Repeat with remaining ingredients, spraying
      the griddle with cooking spray between each pancake.
    </li>
  </ol>
